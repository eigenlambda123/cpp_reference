# Chapter 0 – Introduction to Programming and C++


This chapter lays the groundwork for learning C++. It explains what programs are, introduces C and C++, and walks you through the basics of setting up a development environment.

### Key Concepts

**What is a Program?**

>  A program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute. Programming languages like C++ allow us to write those instructions in human-readable form.
  
**Why C++?**

>  C++ is a powerful language derived from C. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, making it suitable for systems-level, application, and performance-critical development.

**Development Workflow**

>  C++ source code is written in `.cpp` files, compiled into machine code, and then linked to form an executable. This involves:

  * A **compiler** that converts code to object files
  * A **linker** that combines object files and libraries
  * **Standard libraries** that provide common functions and tools

  

**Setting Up**

>  You'll need an IDE or text editor and a C++ compiler. Popular IDEs include Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, and CLion. You can also use command-line tools like `g++`.

  

- **First Program**

>  Once your environment is ready, you can write a simple `main()` function, compile it, and run your first program.
