# C++ Learning Reference – Based on LearnCpp.com

This repository contains personal notes, code examples, and hands-on mini-projects for learning modern **C++**, following the progression of topics from [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/).

## Purpose

To develop practical C++ skills by:

* Mastering the building blocks of C++ programming
* Applying core C++ concepts to data structures and algorithms
* Reinforcing syntax and memory-level understanding through guided code practice
* Building fluency for both academic courses and systems-level programming

> This series is aligned with core CS topics like **Data Structures**, **Memory Management**, and **System Programming Fundamentals**.
> It also supports coursework for **M028 – CSNC101: Networks and Communication** and **M029 – CP103: Data Structures and Algorithm**.

## Structure

The folder structure follows a learning path inspired by LearnCpp.com but organized for hands-on coding and modular review:

| Folder | Focus Area |
|--------|------------|
| `01_basics/` | Variables, types, operators, input/output, control flow |
| `02_functions/` | Function definitions, return types, parameters, recursion |
| `03_memory_and_arrays/` | Arrays, pointers, references, dynamic memory |
| `04_structs_and_classes/` | Structs, classes, constructors, access control |
| `05_advanced_functions/` | Function overloading, default args, function pointers |
| `06_stl_and_strings/` | Vectors, strings, iterators, common STL usage |
| `07_dsa_patterns/` | Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs |
| `08_low_level_ops/` | Bitwise operations, manual memory, headers/modularity |
| `09_practice_projects/` | Combined projects for review and integration |

Each folder includes:

- A `README.md` summarizing key ideas and usage
- One or more `.cpp` files implementing examples or challenges
- Inline commentary for clarity and revision
