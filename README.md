# C++ Learning Reference – Based on *LearnCpp.com*

This repository contains personal notes, code examples, and hands-on mini-projects for learning modern **C++**, following the progression of topics from [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/).

---

## Purpose

To develop practical C++ skills by:

* Mastering the building blocks of C++ programming
* Applying core C++ concepts to data structures and algorithms
* Reinforcing syntax and memory-level understanding through guided code practice
* Building fluency for both academic courses and systems-level programming

> This series supports topics in **Data Structures**, **Memory Management**, and **System Programming Fundamentals**.
> It also aligns with coursework for:
>
> * **CSNC101: Networks and Communication**
> * **CP103: Data Structures and Algorithms**
